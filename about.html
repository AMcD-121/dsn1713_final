                        <p> At B.A.R.K. we believe every dog deserves a second chance at love and a forever home. Our mission is to rescue, rehabilitate, and rehome dogs in need—offering them safety, care, and the companionship they’ve always deserved. With every wagging tail and happy adoption, we’re reminded that compassion truly changes lives—one paw at a time. </p>

                        <p> We are a compassionate community of animal advocates, rescuers, and volunteers devoted to changing the lives of dogs in need. At B.A.R.K, our journey began with a simple belief—that every dog, no matter their past, deserves a safe place to heal and a family to love them unconditionally. Over the years, that belief has grown into a movement fueled by dedication, empathy, and hope. We work tirelessly to rescue dogs from shelters, abandonment, and neglect, ensuring they receive proper medical care, emotional support, and the chance to rediscover trust. Our team, made up of foster families, adopters, and volunteers, pours their hearts into creating meaningful connections between people and pets. Together, we strive not only to find loving homes but also to build a world where every tail can wag freely and every heart can know the joy of companionship. </p>

                        <h3> History </h3>
                        <p>  Established in September 2001, the Bytown Association for Rescued Kanines (B.A.R.K.) is an all-breed, “no-kill” rescue organization and registered charity, operated primarily by a team of dedicated and experienced volunteers. </p>
                        <p> Our mission is centered on the rescue and rehabilitation of abused, abandoned, and neglected dogs throughout the Ottawa area. We also strive to support families in keeping their pets whenever possible, offering guidance and resources to prevent unnecessary surrender. When space allows, we find new homes for unwanted dogs, prioritizing those in urgent need. Please note that we can only accept owned pets without behavioral or medical issues, as our foster homes must remain available for dogs in critical situations. </p>

Our volunteers come from all walks of life, but we’re united by a deep love for animals and a belief that every act of kindness—no matter how small—can make a lasting difference. </p>
